Bukkit plugin page: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/spawner/

This plugin allows you to gather mob spawners with a Silk Touch enchanted tool.
You also can change the type of spawner you are looking at or holding by using
the /spawner command. For example /spawner creeper will change the spawner to a
creeper spawner.

It will tell you what kind of spawner you interact with.

This plugin may be able to replace other plugins that store mob spawner types
as the item durability. It will also attempt to remove the Silk Touch enchant
from the spawner that some plugins add otherwise players can use them as a Silk
Touch enchanted tool.

It will also prevent explosions from destroying spawners because players were
complaining about this on my server. Preventing them from being destroyed saves
staff work from having to replace them when they are accidentally destroyed by
creepers, etc.

This plugin may use various bits of code I found on the Bukkit forums.

Entities

You can make spawners any of the entity names listed here:
http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/src-html/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html#line.16
Generally you would use the name that appears inside the quotes in the
brackets. For example PigZombie will work while PIG_ZOMBIE will not.
